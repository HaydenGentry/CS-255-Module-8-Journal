CS 255 Module 8 Journal

DriverPass is a company that is focused on providing driver education to students learning to drive. DriverPass contacted our consulting firm on the idea of building out a web-based platform for their users. This platform will allow users to buy driving packages that include in-person driving appointments, in-person lessons on rules of the road, and online materials to study and take practice tests.

One thing I believe I did particularly well during this project is the development of the various UML diagrams that illustrate how the system works. It is important to have clear and complete design documents before entering the development phase of any project. 

One part of the project that I would go back and revise is the limitation section. I feel like I did not adequetly cover all of the limitations that the DriverPass project may experience during development and after launch. Another limitation I could have included is cost, though we did not receive a specific budget from DriverPass; it is expected that a smaller company would also have a tighter development budget. 

The best way we interpreted the users needs is through the interview with personnel from DriverPass. The interview was very infomrative on what features they wanted, how they would work, and how they wanted the whole system to operate. It is important to consider the users needs for a project since it is one way an application is considered successful. If the project can't deliver on the needs of its users, than it does not serve much purpose at all. 

My approach to designing software is to begin with a research and design phase, then move into development, then into testing. I would iterate on this process many times until I have settled upon a design that I am content with. After that there would be an exstensive period of testing, then final touches on the project to make it look presentable before launch. I believe an iterative approach to development creates better software compared to other approaches like Waterfall.
